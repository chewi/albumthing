AlbumThing is a simple client for the XMMS2 music player. It features a very
simple user interface consisting of a list containing all available albums and
a playlist. Clicking an album automatically fills the playlist with its
contents. AlbumThing was inspired by Muine <http://muine-player.org/wiki/Main_Page>.

For a list of required software and installation instructions see the
INSTALL file.
